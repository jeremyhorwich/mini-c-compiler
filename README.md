# C to Assembly Compiler

## Overview
The C to Assembly Compiler is a Windows-based compiler that translates C code into assembly language. This project is developed from scratch ,and has a focus on modularity and extensibility, allowing for easy expansion to support new features or to generate code in other languages with minimal development effort.

## Features
- **C Parsing**: Parses C code into equivalent assembly language. This does *not* include all features of C, but includes enough to run simple programs.
- **Modular Design**: Highly modular architecture facilitates easy feature addition.
- **Error Handling**: Reports compile errors with precise location information and offers predictive solutions.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: C#, C, Python (for scripting assistance)
- **Assembly**: x86_64

## Status
The project is currently in progress.

## Next Steps
- Implement binding features.
- Fix main file for easy compiling from the top level of the program.
- Develop support for additional C language features (e.g., structs, unions).
- Improve documentation and add user guides for setup and usage.
